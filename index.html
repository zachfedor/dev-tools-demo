# Agile in Context

- The traditional method is called Waterfall
- Waterfall works well for tangible products, like building a house:<br>
  Architect &rarr; Contractor &rarr; Plumber
- Digital products are messier and need a different process
- [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

# Common Email Replacements

Email is slow and long-form, but a lot of communication can be short and snappy.

- [Slack](https://slack.com/) - Chat application for businesses, popular with newer companies/startups
- [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) - Microsoft's Slack competitor (don't use Skype for this)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) - Chat application for gamers, but plenty of companies use it too

---

# Potential Uses

- Workspace for Department/Program/Course
- Workspaces have channels for different topics
- Admins can add and manage members and roles
- Add integrations for other services

.fourteen[Students have a central place to help each other out.]

# HTML and the Web

# What is HTML?

- HyperText Markup Language
- Every website is built out of it
- Describe content so the computer understands how to display it

Examples:

- [google.com](https://google.com)
- [ts-cset.github.io/cset-180](https://ts-cset.github.io/cset-180)

---

# What Can You Do With It?

- Build sites for your courses
- Use it in the Portal:
  - Quiz questions
  - Assignment Feeback
  - pretty much any text box

# Python and Scripting

# What is Python?

- Python is a simple programming language
- You can use it to write scripts, small programs to handle repetitive tasks for you
- Examples:
  - A script to randomly pair up students for class work
  - A script to download, rename, and organize assignment submissions
  - A script to help with grading those assignments

---

```python
students = [ ... ]
random.shuffle(students)
one = students[:len(students)//2]
two = students[len(students)//2:]

pairs = []
for i in range(len(two)):
    if i &gt;= len(one):
        pairs.append(['', two[i]])
    else:
        pairs.append([one[i], two[i]])
```
